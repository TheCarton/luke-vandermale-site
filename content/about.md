# Who is this Luke guy? Be brief.

Luke is a programmer, data scientist, writer, and accidental jack-of-all trades living in Somerville, MA.

# Be less brief and use the first person.

I received an M.S of Computer Science from Northeastern in 2023, and a B.S in economics in 2015. Some topics that sap a disproportionate amount of
my attention are the climate crisis, science and science communication, and political policy nerdom.

I have also worked a lot of jobs. Most recently I was a line cook; but I've also been a lifeguard, a dispatcher at Amazon logistics, a customer
service representative and part-time data entry automation clerk, and a teacher's assistant.

It is my ambition to use computers and technology to solve the big problems and further human knowledge.
